#summary Get Started with CaCUDA

= Prepare CUDA Programming Environment =

CaCUDA has been tested with CUDA toolkit 3.0+. Before you go through the following steps, make sure you set up your CUDA programming environment properly. 

The latest CUDA toolkit can be found at [http://developer.nvidia.com/category/zone/cuda-zone NVIDIA CUDA Zone].
You need to
  # Download and install the latest graphic card drivers from NVIDIA.
  # Download and install the CUDA toolkit Version 3.0+
You can then download and try to compile the sample programs in NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK. If you successfully compiled most of the sample codes, you should be ready to test-drive CaCUDA. Otherwise, please continue working on your CUDA programming environment.

= Download =

One can easily check out everything required to run a 3D CFD application with a script [http://www.cactuscode.org/download/GetComponents GetComponents], which can be downloaded by
{{{
$wget http://www.cactuscode.org/download/GetComponents 
$chmod 755 GetComponents
}}}
You can then checkout everything you need with 
{{{ 
$./GetComponents -a http://cacuda.googlecode.com/svn/branches/CACUDA_09302011/manifest/ThornList 
}}}
Everything, including Cactus flesh and the computational toolkit required for CaCUDA, will be checked out in a directory called
{{{
CactusCaCUDA
