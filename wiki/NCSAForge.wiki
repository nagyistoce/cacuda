== Forge Tech Summary ==
We tried out CaCUDACFD3D on [http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/UserInfo/Resources/Hardware/DellNVIDIACluster/ Forge], the latest CPU/GPU hybrid supercomputer system at NCSA.

As a replacement of the previous Tesla cluster [http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/UserInfo/Resources/Hardware/Intel64TeslaCluster/ Lincoln]. 
Forge will combine 18 Dell PowerEdge C6145s that contain 36 nodes of dual-socket/eight-core AMD processors, with M2070 NVIDIA Fermi GPU units housed in Dell's C410x PCI expansion enclosures; there are eight Fermi units for each node, for a total of 288. Each NVIDIA M2070 provides more than 500 gigaflops of double-precision performance and 6GB of GDDR5 memory.

A QDR InfiniBand interconnect fabric will interconnect the nodes; 700 terabytes of GPFS filesystem space will be provided by two Data Direct Networks SFA 10000 units. The I/O bandwidth of the system is expected to exceed 16GB/sec.
